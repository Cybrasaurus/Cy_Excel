# Cy_Excel UNDER CONSTRUCTION
A Python Module for Handling Excel Files.

The goal is to allow a user to set up a macro on how raw excel data is formatted, copied or transformed and then output to a different, combined output Excel. 

# Why make this
A suprising amount of hours are spent copying excel columns from one excel into the other at work, some of them are exports from systems with a bad/nonexistant API, others are excels provided by another division within the workplace.
The same copying and formatting is done at regular intervals, each time with the same shema. This module is supposed to automate those tasks.
This intended user is someone with little to no programming experience, who can specify the steps in a config file (or even a gui down the road)
